# PuLID-Diffusers

A library that integrates PuLID with Hugging Face's Diffusers, providing new pipelines adapted for diffusion models like SDXL and FLUX.

This integration allows loading PuLID into diffusion models to maintain identity consistency in generated images, ensuring facial coherence and identity preservation. It also retains compatibility with ControlNet and IP-Adapter for enhanced control over image generation.

Based on the original PuLID repository, PuLID-Diffusers enables identity customization in image generation, ensuring high fidelity and editability.
